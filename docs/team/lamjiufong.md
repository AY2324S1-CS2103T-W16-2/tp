### Project: EzContact

EzContact is a desktop app made for insurance agents to manage customer details,
optimized for usage via Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, EzContact can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Priority feature.
  * What it does: Allows users to assign, update or remove priorities from customers in EzContact.
  * Justification: This feature is well-suited for our target users as now they can classify customers into different 
  priorities levels, allowing them to know who should they find first for a higher chance of sealing the deal.
  * Highlights: 
    * Users can assign three different priority levels: high, medium and low. They can also choose to update or remove the 
    priorities assigned to users. 
    * The customer list is now sorted according to priority levels, allowing users to have a clear view on who has higher priorities.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=LamJiuFong&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)

* **Project management**:
  * Have weekly meetings and brainstorm sessions to decide direction of the project.
  * Have some commits and merged some pull requests in every milestone.
  * Have some reviews and comments on teammates' pull requests.
  * Set up codecov and project website.
  * Changed EzContact's icon and included some vectors for UI.
  * Maintain and update project websites.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Edit feature is not allowed to edit tags, this is to make way for the `tag` feature where users can now add or delete tags without clearing all existing tags.
  * Users can now add priorities through the `add` feature.
  * Displayed customer list is now in sorted form, ordered by priority levels.
  * Customers' phone, email and address are now displayed in a better form. 

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide: `to be added soon`
  * Developer Guide: `to be added soon`

* **Community**:
  * PR reviews
  * Reported bugs
